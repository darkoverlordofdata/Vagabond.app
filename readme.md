# Vagabond Practice Amp

First of all, Guitarix is pretty awesome. I use it often on Ubuntu Studio. But that's the thing. I run Studio because I can't get all the piecs working on other os. It's great for recording, but overkill for practice, and not very portable.

My goal with Vagabond is a practice amp then runs anywhere. It doesn't reqire jackd. It can't be used as a VST plugin on a daw. But it run's anywhere (that's the plan, anyway). 

* Writen in python, with C for performance, it's a low latency program.
* Uses alsa, so you can jam along with YouTube
* No expensive interface required - I'm using a cheap microphone/headphone to usb connector - https://www.dukabel.com/product_DUSB352FB.php, with a 1/4" to 1/8" guitar cable.
